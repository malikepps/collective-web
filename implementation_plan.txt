# Collective Web App Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a methodical approach to develop the web version of Collective with 100% accuracy to the Swift iOS app. The web app will use Next.js, React, and Firebase, sharing the backend with the iOS app.

## Phase 1: Analysis & Planning

### 1.1 Swift Codebase Analysis

- Document all error handling strategies

### 1.2 Firebase Structure Analysis
- Document the Firestore collections and documents structure
- Identify all Firebase Authentication methods used
- Document Cloud Storage usage patterns
- Map out security rules and access patterns
- Identify any Firebase Cloud Functions being used

### 1.3 Asset Inventory
- Extract all images, icons, and media assets
- Document all colors, typography, and dimensions
- Identify theme-related variables and constants
- Extract all text content and localization strings

## Phase 2: Core Setup

- Set up URL structure for all content types
- Implement routing for notification deep links

## Phase 6: Firebase Integration

### 6.1 Authentication Implementation
- Implement phone authentication flow
- Create user document creation and management
- Set up session management
- Implement account linking if used

### 6.2 Data Fetching
- Implement real-time listeners for key data
- Create pagination strategies matching iOS app
- Implement offline capability if present in iOS
- Build optimistic UI updates

### 6.3 Data Mutations
- Implement create/update/delete operations
- Build transaction logic for complex operations
- Create batch update capabilities
- Implement error handling and retries

## Phase 7: Testing and Verification

### 7.1 Visual Testing
- Perform side-by-side comparisons with iOS app
- Verify all colors, spacing, and typography
- Test responsive behavior at all breakpoints
- Verify animations and transitions

### 7.2 Functional Testing
- Test all user flows match iOS app
- Verify all CRUD operations work identically
- Test error states and recovery
- Verify offline behavior if applicable

### 7.3 Cross-Browser Testing
- Test on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge
- Verify iOS Safari behavior for mobile web
- Test Android Chrome for mobile web
- Address any browser-specific issues

## Phase 8: Performance Optimization

### 8.1 Loading Performance
- Implement code splitting for routes
- Optimize image loading and display
- Implement prefetching for anticipated routes
- Add loading states matching iOS app

### 8.2 Runtime Performance
- Optimize render performance for lists
- Implement virtualization for long lists
- Optimize Firebase query patterns
- Reduce unnecessary re-renders

## Phase 9: Progressive Web App Features

### 9.1 Offline Capabilities
- Implement service worker for caching
- Create offline-first data strategy
- Build offline UI states
- Implement background sync

### 9.2 Installation Experience
- Configure manifest.json
- Create app icons in all required sizes
- Implement install promotion UI
- Test installation flow on iOS and Android

## Implementation Sequence

For each component or screen:

1. Review Swift implementation in detail
2. Document exact styling, behavior, and functionality
3. Create web implementation matching detail
4. Get approval on single component before proceeding
5. Integrate component into larger context
6. Perform side-by-side comparison with iOS app
7. Make adjustments until 100% accuracy is achieved
8. Document any technical limitations and solutions

## Development Guidelines

1. **No Assumptions**: Never assume implementation details
2. **Exact Styling**: Pixel-perfect matching of all UI elements
3. **Behavior Matching**: All interactions must match iOS app exactly
4. **Approval Process**: Get sign-off on each component before proceeding
5. **Documentation**: Document all implementation decisions and references to Swift code
6. **Testing Protocol**: Test each component in isolation and in context
7. **Iteration**: Be prepared to refine implementations multiple times until perfect

## Milestones and Deliverables

1. **Foundation Ready**: Core setup, Firebase configuration, and basic models
2. **Component Library**: All UI components matching iOS app
3. **Auth Flow**: Complete authentication experience matching iOS
4. **Core Screens**: Main app screens with navigation
5. **Interactive Features**: All user interactions and features
6. **Full Feature Parity**: All iOS app capabilities implemented
7. **PWA Capabilities**: Offline features and installation experience
8. **Production Ready**: Fully tested and optimized for deployment
