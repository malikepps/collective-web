## 9. HOME FEED IMPLEMENTATION

### 9.1 Home Feed Components

Build the main components for the home feed:
1. **HomeView**:
   - Main container for the feed
   - Quick access organization section
   - Post feed section
   - Pull-to-refresh functionality

2. **QuickAccessSection**:
   - Horizontal scrolling list of organizations
   - Organization avatars with indicators
   - Join suggestions for new users

3. **PostFeed**:
   - Virtualized scrolling list for performance
   - Post cards with media
   - Loading states and placeholders
   - Empty state handling

4. **LoadMoreTrigger**:
   - Automatic loading of additional content
   - Loading indicators
   - Error state handling

### 9.2 Data Fetching Strategy

Implement efficient data loading:
- Initial post batch loading
- Lazy loading of additional posts
- Prefetching of media assets
- Caching of post data
- Background refresh of content

### 9.3 User Interaction Handling

Support these interactions:
- Post liking and reaction
- Comment creation and viewing
- Organization profile navigation
- Content sharing
- Media viewing optimizations

### 9.4 Performance Optimizations

Implement these optimization techniques:
- Windowed list rendering
- Image lazy loading and placeholders
- Video playback optimization (poster frames, deferred loading)
- Content prefetching during idle time
- Pagination with cursor-based queries

### 9.5 Filter & Sort Options

Create filter functionality:
- Content filtering UI
- Sort options (recent, popular)
- Filter by relationship (members, staff, etc.)
- Save user preferences

### 9.6 Implementation Plan

1. Build home view structure and layout
2. Implement quick access organization section
3. Create virtualized post list component
4. Build post card component with media support
5. Implement data fetching service with pagination
6. Add pull-to-refresh functionality
7. Create loading states and placeholders
8. Implement filter and sort options
9. Add post interaction handlers


## 10. TESTING AND OPTIMIZATION

### 10.1 Testing Strategy

Implement testing at multiple levels:
- Unit tests for utility functions and hooks
- Component tests for UI elements
- Integration tests for key user flows
- End-to-end tests for critical paths
- Mobile device testing across various devices

### 10.2 Performance Optimization

Focus on these key areas:
- Initial load time optimization
- Bundle size reduction
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Image and media optimization
- Firebase query optimization
- Rendering performance improvements

### 10.3 Cross-Browser Compatibility

Ensure compatibility with:
- Chrome for Android
- Safari for iOS
- Firefox Mobile
- Samsung Internet Browser
- Edge Mobile

### 10.4 Accessibility Improvements

Implement accessibility features:
- Proper semantic HTML
- ARIA attributes where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast compliance
- Screen reader compatibility

### 10.5 Error Handling & Monitoring

Set up robust error management:
- Global error boundary implementation
- Error logging and reporting
- Graceful degradation for API failures
- Retry mechanisms for transient errors
- User feedback for error states

- Code quality checks

### 11.3 Firebase Configuration

Configure Firebase for production:
- Security rules review and testing
- Index optimization for queries
- Storage bucket configuration
- Authentication settings
- Analytics and monitoring setup

### 11.4 Monitoring & Analytics

Set up production monitoring:
- Error tracking with Sentry or similar
- Performance monitoring
- User analytics
- Firebase Analytics integration
- Custom event tracking

### 11.5 Post-Launch Plan

Prepare for ongoing maintenance:
- Monitoring dashboard setup
- Regular performance audits
