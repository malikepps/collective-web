## 7. MEMBERSHIP AND PAYMENT IMPLEMENTATION

### 7.1 Membership Models

Define data models for membership functionality:
- Membership tiers
- User membership status
- Payment history
- Subscription status

Reference the Swift MembershipTier.swift file for the data structure.

### 7.2 Stripe Integration

Set up Stripe integration for payment processing:
- Configure Stripe Elements for payment form UI
- Implement Stripe customer creation
- Set up payment intent creation
- Handle subscription creation and management
- Process one-time payments for custom amounts

### 7.3 Membership UI Components

Create UI components for membership display and interaction:
1. **Membership Options View**:
   - Display available membership tiers
   - Show pricing and benefits
   - Highlight recommended plans
   - Support custom amount entry

2. **Payment Form**:
   - Credit card input with validation
   - Billing information collection
   - Secure payment processing
   - Error handling and success confirmations

3. **Member Badge**:
   - Visual indicator of membership status
   - Different styling for different membership types
   - Theme-based styling

### 7.4 Membership Management

Implement functionality for:
- Checking membership status
- Processing membership upgrades/downgrades
- Handling subscription cancellations
- Displaying membership history
- Billing information management

### 7.5 Firebase Implementation

Integrate with Firebase for:
- Storing membership information
- Tracking payment status
- Recording subscription details
- Managing user relationships with organizations

### 7.6 Member-Only Content Access

Implement logic for:
- Checking content visibility permissions
- Displaying or hiding member-only content
- Encouraging non-members to join
- Preview blurred member content to non-members

### 7.7 Custom Membership Support

Build functionality for:
- Custom amount selection
- Different payment frequencies (monthly, annual, one-time)
- Gift membership options
- Promotions and discounts

### 7.8 Implementation Plan

1. Set up Stripe account and API keys
2. Create membership tier interfaces and services
3. Implement membership display components
4. Build payment form with Stripe Elements
5. Create membership status checking services
6. Implement server-side payment processing (using Vercel serverless functions)
7. Build member-only content access control
8. Create membership management components
9. Implement webhook handlers for subscription events

### 7.9 Security Considerations

- Use Stripe Elements to avoid handling card data directly
- Implement proper authentication checks for membership status
- Verify membership server-side before granting access to content
- Secure API keys in environment variables
- Implement idempotent payment processing
