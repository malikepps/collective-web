Dr. Pauli Murray was a trailblazing activist, legal scholar, and Episcopal priest (to name just a few). Pauli was born in Baltimore, but was raised in Durham - eventually graduating from Hillside High School in 1926. A fierce advocate for social justice, Pauli co-founded the National Organization for Women (NOW) and played a significant role in shaping landmark legal decisions, including Brown v. Board of Education. Pauli‚Äôs work continues to influence the intersection of civil rights and gender equality.\n\nTo learn more, visit: https://buff.ly/3v0WVpu üîó in bio üëÜüèº \n\nüì∏ Pauli Murray Center - Mural, Pauli Murray Roots & Soul, Location: 1101 West Chapel Hill Street\n\n#DurhamCares #CommunityFirst #Durham #DurhamNC #Durm #BlackHistoryMonth",
